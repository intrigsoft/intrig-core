# React Overview

The **React** section of the Intrig documentation covers everything you need to know to use the SDK effectively within a React application. It’s organized into five key areas that build on each other, from core concepts to advanced usage.

---

## 1) Core Concepts

Understand the foundational ideas that power Intrig’s React integration. This includes how network state is managed, the differences between stateful and stateless hooks, binding hooks to the component lifecycle, and structuring components hierarchically for optimal data reuse.

## 2) API

Dive into the specific building blocks provided by the SDK — from the `IntrigProvider` for global configuration, to the various hook types (stateful, stateless, SSE, download) and the `Network State` utilities for safe and predictable rendering.

## 3) Tutorial

Follow guided, practical examples that walk you through setting up and using Intrig in real-world scenarios. Tutorials cover basic setup, authentication, error handling, different update strategies, handling duplicate requests, file operations, and server-sent events.

## 4) Cookbook

Learn practical patterns, shortcuts, and tips for working efficiently with Intrig in React. The cookbook addresses common scenarios such as binding hooks to the component lifecycle, using shorthand syntax, caching previous state, and managing duplicate state.
