# Next.js Overview

The **Next.js** section of the Intrig documentation covers everything you need to know to use the SDK effectively within a Next.js application. It's organized into five key areas that build on each other, from core concepts to advanced usage patterns specific to Next.js full-stack development.

---

## 1) Core Concepts

Understand the foundational ideas that power Intrig's Next.js integration. This includes server-side functions, client-side hooks, App Router patterns, Pages Router patterns, API route integration, and how to structure your Next.js application for optimal data flow between server and client components.

## 2) API

Dive into the specific building blocks provided by the SDK — from server-side functions for API routes and server components, to client-side hooks, streaming with Server-Sent Events, file uploads/downloads, and middleware integration patterns.

---

## 3) Tutorial

Follow guided, practical examples that walk you through setting up and using Intrig in real-world Next.js scenarios. Tutorials cover App Router setup, Pages Router setup, server-side data fetching, client-side state management, authentication flows, and hybrid server/client patterns.
