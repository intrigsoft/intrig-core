# Why Intrig?

API development has evolved significantly over the years, but many teams still struggle with fragmented toolchains, inconsistent developer experiences, and time-consuming integration work. Intrig was built to solve these fundamental challenges.

## The Problem with Traditional API Development

Most API development workflows involve:

- **Manual SDK generation** or no SDKs at all
- **Disconnected frontend and backend development**
- **Inconsistent type safety** between client and server
- **Complex integration patterns** that vary by framework
- **Time-consuming documentation maintenance**

## How Intrig Changes the Game

Intrig provides a unified platform that connects your API backend directly to your frontend applications through automatically generated, type-safe SDKs.

### Key Benefits

- **Zero Configuration SDK Generation**: Automatically generate type-safe SDKs for any frontend framework
- **Unified Developer Experience**: Consistent patterns across React and Next.js
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Changes to your API are immediately reflected in your frontend code
- **Production Ready**: Built for scale with enterprise-grade features

## Who Benefits from Intrig?
