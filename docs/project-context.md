# Intrig Project Context

## What Intrig Is

Intrig is a TypeScript SDK generator for production environments. It generates type-safe, framework-specific client code from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.

## Key Innovations

1. **Clean Architecture**: Generated SDK compiles to node_modules (not dumped in project)
2. **Insight Tool**: Daemon-powered searchable API documentation with copy-paste code
3. **Build-time Validation**: Breaking changes surface as compilation errors
4. **Up to 50% Time Savings**: Measured reduction in frontend integration time

## Target Audience

Professional software engineers who:
- Have formal education and UI domain knowledge
- Work with TypeScript/React/Next.js in production
- Make architectural decisions for teams
- Evaluate tools on technical merit and production viability
- Value precision over enthusiasm

## Future Roadmap

- IDE plugins (VSCode, IntelliJ)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- Additional framework support (Vue, Angular, Svelte)

## Documentation Philosophy

Documentation targets professional engineers evaluating production infrastructure. Tone should be:
- Technical and precise
- Professional without marketing language
- Factual rather than persuasive
- Complete and accurate

This is infrastructure tooling with enterprise implications, not a consumer product.
